> In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Helios is the god who personifies the Sun.

`helios` is a stochastic individual-based infectious disease transmission model that simulates the effect of far ultra-violet light emitters as a method for curtailing disease transmission.
`helios` is built using the [`individual`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/individual) package developed at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `helios` from GitHub using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/helios")
```
