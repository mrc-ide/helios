> In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Helios is the god who
> personifies the Sun.

`helios` is a stochastic individual-based infectious disease
transmission model that simulates the effect of far ultra-violet light
emitters as a method for curtailing disease transmission. `helios` is
built using the [`individual`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/individual)
package developed at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease
Analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `helios` from GitHub using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/helios")
```

  gives a more detailed description of the model

## Working reports

- **May 2024**: [Assessing far UVC interventions with an individual
  based infectious disease
  model](https://mrc-ide.github.io/helios/articles/blueprint.html)
  introduces the `helios` package and demonstrates its application in
  simulating installation of far UVC interventions and their impact on
  disease dynamics
- **July 2024**: [Update to “assessing far UVC interventions with an
  individual based infectious disease
  model”](https://mrc-ide.github.io/helios/articles/blueprint-july.html)
  describes two updates to our initial model, and…
