<!-- badges: end -->

Helios is a stochastic, spatially-explicit, individual-based infectious
disease transmission model that simulates the effect of far ultra-violet
light emitters as a method for curtailing disease transmission. Helios
is built using the `individual` package (REF).

## Installation

You can install the development version of Helios from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("tbreweric/Helios")

``` r
#library(Helios)
