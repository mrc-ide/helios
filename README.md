`helios` is a stochastic individual-based infectious disease
transmission model that simulates the effect of far ultra-violet light
emitters as a method for curtailing disease transmission. `helios` is
built using the [`individual`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/individual)
package developed at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease
Analysis.
