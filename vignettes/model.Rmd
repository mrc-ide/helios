This vignette describes the modelling approach used in `helios`.
For an introduction to practical use of the package, see the [Get started](https://mrc-ide.github.io/helios/articles/helios.html) vignette.

## Population

The population consists of a fixed number of individuals.
Each individual has properties.
Some properties remain constant over time, and others which change.

## Age structure

The age categories included in the model are children, adults, and the elderly.
Each individual has a fixed age category.

## Households

Households are comprised of collections of one or more individuals.

## Workplaces

Workplaces are attended by adults.
The sizes of workplaces are drawn from the following distribution.
Assignment of adults to particular workplaces is at random.


## Schools

Schools are attended by children.
The sizes of schools are drawn from the following distribution.
Assignment of children to particular schools is at random.

## Leisure

Leisure venues are attended by who.
Leisure venue sizes are drawn from the following distribution.

## Community mixing

Overall community mixing is implemented via some mechanism.

## Interventions

To be described once implemented!

## Disease states

We consider a SEIR compartmental model with susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered disease states.
At a given time, each individual is in exactly one of the states $\{S, E, I, R\}$.
Transitions between states are simulated as follows.

### Transition from state $S \to E$

The total force of infection $\lambda$ for each individual is a sum of household, workplace, school, leisure, and community specific force of infections
$$
\lambda = \lambda_h + \lambda_w + \lambda_s + \lambda_l + \lambda_c.
$$
The location specific force of infection terms are given as:

* Household $\lambda_h$:
* Workplace  $\lambda_w$:
* School $\lambda_s$:
* Leisure $\lambda_l$:
* Community $\lambda_c$:

The probability of infection in a given time step $\delta > 0$ is
$$
\mathbb{P}(S \to E) = 1 - \exp(\lambda \delta)
$$

### Transition from state $E \to I$

Individuals progress from exposed to infectious with a random delay $d \geq 1$ such that
$$
c \sim \text{Gamma}(2\gamma, 2), \\
d = \text{round}(c + 1).
$$
where $\gamma > 0$ is the duration exposed which we set to 2.
The delay $d$ is a number of time steps $\delta$.

### Transition from state $I \to R$

Individuals progress from infectious to recovered after a random disease duration $f \geq 1$ such that
$$
e \sim \text{Gamma}(2\upsilon, 2), \\
f = \text{round}(e + 1).
$$
where $\upsilon$ is the duration of infectiousness which we set to 4.
The disease duration $f$ is a number of time steps $\delta$.
