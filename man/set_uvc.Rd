)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters_list}{A list of parameters as generated using \code{get_parameters()}}

\item{setting}{A character string describing the setting type in which far UVC is being deployed}

\item{coverage}{A numeric value describing the coverage of far UVC within the setting class for which which far UVC is deployed}

\item{coverage_target}{A character describing the target of the coverage ("buildings" or "individuals")}

\item{coverage_type}{A character describing the type of coverage ("random" or "targeted")}

\item{efficacy}{A numeric value describing the efficacy of the far UVC deployed}

\item{timestep}{A numeric value describing the timestep in which far UVC is deployed}
}
\description{
The \code{set_uvc()} function is a user-facing function that is used to parameterise far UVC deployment
for an individual setting type (e.g. workplace). The function takes as arguments a \code{helios}
parameter list, the \code{setting} type for which far UVC deployment is being parameterised, the \code{coverage}
of far UVC within each location of a setting type (e.g. coverage of individual workplaces within
the workplace setting class), the \code{coverage_type} (currently supporting random and targeted at the
most populated settings), the \code{efficacy} of far UVC in the setting type, and the \code{timestep} on
which far UVC is deployed. The function appends these additional setting-specific parameters to
the parameter list and returns an updated version of it.
