\description{
generate_betas() takes a beta_community and returns beta_household, beta_school, beta_workplace,
and beta_leisure given user-defined ratios. The function also calculates the total beta value and
returns the proportion of the total corresponding to each setting. The beta values are key inputs
in the parameters_list as generated using the \code{get_parameters()} function. The function returns a
dataframe containing the beta values and their proportions of the total betas.
