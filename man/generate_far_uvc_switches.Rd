\description{
generate_far_uvc_switches() determines which individual settings will deploy far UVC given the settings
switched on, the setting-specific coverages, and the setting-specific coverage types. The function returns
generates, for each the workplace, school, leisure, and household settings, a vector of length equal to the
the number of settings within in setting type (e.g. number of schools within the school setting class)
populated with 1's and 0's, where a 1 represents the presence of far UVC and a 0 the absence of far
UVC. The function returns an updated parameter list with these vectors appended for each setting class
for which far UVC has been parameterised using the \code{set_uvc()} function.
