\description{
This function creates a named list of model parameters which are to be used
in the model. For example, the output of \code{\link[=get_parameters]{get_parameters()}} provides input to
functions such as \code{\link[=create_variables]{create_variables()}} and \code{\link[=create_events]{create_events()}}.
